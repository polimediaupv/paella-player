_Easily embed and control Paella Player with a YouTube-like iframe API_

Paella-embed is a library for embedding the Paella Player in your web pages while controlling playback via an API compatible with the YouTube Player IFrame API.

It lets you instantiate the player inside an iframe, listen to player events, and invoke familiar methods (play, pause, seek, load video, set volume, mute/unmute, change playback rate, etc.) using the same interface shape as YouTube’s IFrame embeds. 

This makes it straightforward to migrate existing YouTube-API-based integrations or build custom controls and interactive experiences around Paella Player with minimal code changes.
